SheetYourself
=============

_Introduction_

SheetYourself is a simple sprite sheet generator for Windows. Given a source folder, it will compile all images found in the source folder into a single compact sprite sheet image file and an XML file defining the size and position of each image in the sprite sheet. Transparent pixels can be optionally cropped out of source images. At this time, SheetYourself does not rotate images to make a more compact sprite sheet and uses a naive packing process.

_Code Versions_

The previous Visual Studio 2010 version has been eliminated and the Visual Studio 2012 version upgraded to Visual Studio 2013.
